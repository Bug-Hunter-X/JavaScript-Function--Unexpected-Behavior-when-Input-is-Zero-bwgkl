# JavaScript Function: Unexpected Behavior when Input is Zero

This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript functions: improper handling of zero inputs. The function `foo` divides two numbers; however, it does not gracefully handle the case where either input is zero, leading to potential errors or unexpected results.  The solution showcases how to handle the zero input case effectively.  The buggy code is located in `bug.js` and the corrected solution is in `bugSolution.js`.
